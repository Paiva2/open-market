# Open Market Project

This is an Open Market project, inspired by a Market system from a game (Tibia Server) that I played.
In this market, users can interact with items and perform various actions, such as:
- Listing items for sale
- Removing listings
- Trading items
- Making and receiving offers on items
- Applying filters
- And other features

Unlike the original game market, this platform will allow users to list any type of item they want to sell.
